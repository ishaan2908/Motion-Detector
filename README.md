# Motion Detector

This software searches through the computer's camera for a moving object. After successful execution, the program generates the output in the form of a graph that indicates the time period in which the object was in motion. Also, a CSV file gets generated containing the time data.

### How it works?
* Run the Graph Plotting.py file.
* It calls for the execution of Motion_Detector.py file which triggers the computer's camera to detect a moving object.
* Then, the Graph Plotting.py program executes.
* After closing the program, a web page opens containing the Time Graph.
* Also, a file Time Data.csv is generated having the tabular data of the Time Graph.
